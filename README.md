This project aims to recreate the [R-Type](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-Type) game and add a multiplayer mode to it. we had to implement a multi-threaded server using [Boost::asio](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html) and a graphical client in [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
